## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This commmand will install all the dependencies listed in package.json.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make any edits.\
You will also see errors appearing in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The built app is ready for the Deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Eject is a one-way operation!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, ...) into your project.
All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
